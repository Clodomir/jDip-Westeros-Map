Updating the map
================
The map.svg file is a Inkscape SVG.  Use it to define label, unit placement, mouse areas, etc.  It has a very
specific format that should probably be documented somewhere, but for now you will have to dig in and get
your hands dirty to understand what things are important and what things aren't.  Here are some hints:

  * Objects must be defined in the correct layer to be useful
  * The object "id"'s matter a lot
  * Inkscape adds <tspan> elements when placing text.  It's best to probably copy-paste an
    existing text item
  * The text items need to have a correct CSS class
  * The SC and UNIT rectangles need to be the correct size
  * The MapLayer and MouseLayer are expected to only contain <path> elements
